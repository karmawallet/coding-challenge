# Karma Wallet Coding Challenge

## Getting Started
- Create a new public repo on github named `kw-coding-challenge-response`. You can proceed with the default options selected.
- Locally, create a new directory on your computer for this coding challenge
- In your terminal, clone the `karmawallet/coding-challenge` repository with your protocol of choice:
    - ssh: `git clone git@github.com:karmawallet/coding-challenge.git`
    - https: `git clone https://github.com/karmawallet/coding-challenge.git`
- Once you have the locally cloned repo for `karmawallet/coding-challenge`, cd into the repo directory and set the upstream for your code to the repo you created, again with the protocol of your choice:
   - ssh: `git remote set-url origin git@github.com/yourname/kw-coding-challenge-response.git`
   - https: `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/karmawallet/coding-challenge.git`

## Running the Code

- Once you've created your remote repo copied from this repo, run `npm install` locally
- To spin up the code, run `npm start`, this should open up your browser. If it does not you can navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.
- When you want to commit your code to your repo, run:
  - `git add`
  - `git commit -m 'your commit message text'`
  - `git push`
